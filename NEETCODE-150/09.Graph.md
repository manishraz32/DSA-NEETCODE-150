# [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
Medium


Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
 ```

Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 300
- grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

## Approach
```
- DFS
- number of time DFS called is the ans
```

## Soluiton
```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        boolean[][] mark = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if(!mark[i][j] && grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    res++;
                    dfs(grid, i, j, mark);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int i, int j, boolean[][] mark) {
        if(i < 0 || i >= grid.length || j < 0 || j >= grid[0].length || mark[i][j] || grid[i][j] == '0')
            return;
        mark[i][j] = true;
        dfs(grid, i+1, j, mark);
        dfs(grid, i, j-1, mark);
        dfs(grid, i-1, j, mark);
        dfs(grid, i, j+1, mark);
    }

# [695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)
Medium


You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [
[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
``` 

Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

## Approach
```
- DFS
- count number of dfs call inside
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
        boolean[][] mark = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        int res = 0;

       for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
           for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
               if (!mark[i][j] && grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    res = Math.max(res, dfs(grid, i, j, mark));
               }
           }
       }
        return res;
    }

    private int dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j, boolean[][] mark) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= grid.length || j < 0 || j >= grid[0].length || mark[i][j] || grid[i][j] == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        mark[i][j] = true;
        return (1 + dfs(grid, i + 1, j, mark) +
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1, mark) +
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j, mark) +
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1, mark));

# [133. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)
Medium


Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.
```java
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
 ```

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```
Example 2:
```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
``` 

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 100
- Node.val is unique for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

## Approach
```

```

## Solution
```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
    public Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    public Node(int _val, ArrayList<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
}
*/

class Solution {

    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if(node == null) return node;
        LinkedList<Node> que = new LinkedList<Node>();
        HashMap<Node, Node> map = new HashMap<>();
        que.add(node);
        map.put(node, new Node(node.val));

        while(que.size() > 0) {
            Node removedNode = que.removeFirst();
            for(Node neighbor : removedNode.neighbors) {
                if(!map.containsKey(neighbor)) {
                    que.add(neighbor);
                    map.put(neighbor, new Node(neighbor.val));
                }
                map.get(removedNode).neighbors.add(map.get(neighbor));
            }
            
        }
        return map.get(node);
    }

}

# 663 Â· Walls and Gates

Medium

Description
You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

-1 : A wall or an obstacle.

0 : A gate.

INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.

Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a Gate, that room should remain filled with INF


Example 1
```
Input:
[
[2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],
[2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],
[2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],
[0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]]
Output:
[
[3,-1,0,1],
[2,2,1,-1],
[1,-1,2,-1],
[0,-1,3,4]]

Explanation:
the 2D grid is:
INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF
the answer is:
  3  -1   0   1
  2   2   1  -1
  1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1   3   4
```
Example 2
```
Input:
[
[0,-1],
[2147483647,2147483647]]
Output:
[
[0,-1],
[1,2]]

## Approach
```
- BFS or Topological Sort
- Start from the grid having 0 (add them to a queue)
- while queue is not empty:
  - if neighbour of current position is INF, change it to 1+val coming from the queue and add it to queue
  - otherwise take min of neighour's value and 1+val
```

## Solution
```java
    public void wallsAndGates(int[][] rooms) {
        if (rooms == null || rooms.length == 0) return;
        
        int rows = rooms.length, cols = rooms[0].length;
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        int INF = 2147483647;
        int[][] directions = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};

        // Step 1: Add all gates (0s) to the queue
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (rooms[r][c] == 0) {
                    queue.offer(new int[]{r, c});
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Perform BFS to update distances
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cell = queue.poll();
            int r = cell[0], c = cell[1];

            for (int[] dir : directions) {
                int nr = r + dir[0], nc = c + dir[1];

                // If it's within bounds and is an empty room (INF), update distance
                if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && rooms[nr][nc] == INF) {
                    rooms[nr][nc] = rooms[r][c] + 1;
                    queue.offer(new int[]{nr, nc});
                }
            }
        }
    }
