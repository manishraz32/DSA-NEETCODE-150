# [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
Medium


Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
 ```

Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 300
- grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

## Approach
```
- DFS
- number of time DFS called is the ans
```

## Soluiton
```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        boolean[][] mark = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if(!mark[i][j] && grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    res++;
                    dfs(grid, i, j, mark);
                }
            }

# [695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)
Medium


You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [
[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
``` 

Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

## Approach
```

```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
        boolean[][] mark = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        int res = 0;

# [133. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)
Medium


Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.
```java
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
 ```

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```
Example 2:
```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
``` 

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 100
- Node.val is unique for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

## Approach
```

```

## Solution
```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
    public Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    public Node(int _val, ArrayList<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
}
*/

class Solution {

    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if(node == null) return node;
        LinkedList<Node> que = new LinkedList<Node>();
        HashMap<Node, Node> map = new HashMap<>();
        que.add(node);
        map.put(node, new Node(node.val));

        while(que.size() > 0) {
            Node removedNode = que.removeFirst();
            for(Node neighbor : removedNode.neighbors) {
                if(!map.containsKey(neighbor)) {
                    que.add(neighbor);
                    map.put(neighbor, new Node(neighbor.val));
                }
                map.get(removedNode).neighbors.add(map.get(neighbor));

# 663 · Walls and Gates

Medium

Description
You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

-1 : A wall or an obstacle.

0 : A gate.

INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.

Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a Gate, that room should remain filled with INF


Example 1
```
Input:
[
[2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],
[2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],
[2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],
[0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]]
Output:
[
[3,-1,0,1],
[2,2,1,-1],
[1,-1,2,-1],
[0,-1,3,4]]

Explanation:
the 2D grid is:
INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF
the answer is:
  3  -1   0   1
  2   2   1  -1
  1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1   3   4
```
Example 2
```
Input:
[
[0,-1],
[2147483647,2147483647]]
Output:
[
[0,-1],
[1,2]]
```

## Approach
```
- BFS or Topological Sort
- Start from the grid having 0 (add them to a queue)
- while queue is not empty:
  - if neighbour of current position is INF, change it to 1+val coming from the queue and add it to queue
  - otherwise take min of neighour's value and 1+val
```

## Solution
```java
    public void wallsAndGates(int[][] rooms) {
        if (rooms == null || rooms.length == 0) return;
        
        int rows = rooms.length, cols = rooms[0].length;
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        int INF = 2147483647;
        int[][] directions = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};

        // Step 1: Add all gates (0s) to the queue
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (rooms[r][c] == 0) {
                    queue.offer(new int[]{r, c});
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Perform BFS to update distances
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cell = queue.poll();
            int r = cell[0], c = cell[1];

            for (int[] dir : directions) {
                int nr = r + dir[0], nc = c + dir[1];

                // If it's within bounds and is an empty room (INF), update distance
                if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && rooms[nr][nc] == INF) {
                    rooms[nr][nc] = rooms[r][c] + 1;
                    queue.offer(new int[]{nr, nc});
                }
            }

# [994. Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)
Medium


You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

- 0 representing an empty cell,
- 1 representing a fresh orange, or
- 2 representing a rotten orange.
- 
Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
 ```

Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 10
- grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.

## Approaches
```
- Implementation of Topological Sort
- Insert all the rotten tomatoes inside the queue as sources
- have an fresh tomato count
- while sources queue not empty,
  - we pull one pos at a time and check it's neighbour if there is any fresh tomato
  - if we found fresh tomato, we make it rotten and add to our sources queue, decrement the fresh count
  - for each run of while loop,
    - we check if the sources is not empty, increment the time
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
     public int orangesRotting(int[][] grid) {
        int[][] dir = {{0,-1}, {-1,0}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}};

# [417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow]()
Medium


There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]

```
Example 2:
```
Input: heights = [[2,1],[1,2]]
Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]]
``` 

Constraints:

- m == heights.length
- n == heights[r].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 200

Explanation: Surrounded regions should not be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
 ```

Constraints:

- m == board.length
- n == board[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 200
- board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.

## Approach
```
- start dfs from all the boundaries
- mark all the cells that can be reach from the dfs as 1
- all those which were not marked 1 and in give board is "0", set them "X"
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        int rows = board.length;
        int cols = board[0].length;
        int[][] dir = { { 1, 0 }, { -1, 0 }, { 0, -1 }, { 0, 1 } };
        
        for(int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if( (i == 0 || j == 0 || i == (rows - 1) || j == (cols - 1)) && 
                  board[i][j] == 'O') {
                    dfs(board, i, j, dir);
                }

                    board[i][j] = 'X';
                if(board[i][j] == '#') 
                    board[i][j] = 'O';
                    
            }
        }
        
    }
    
    public void dfs(char[][] board, int sr, int sc, int[][] dir) {
        board[sr][sc] = '#';
        
        for(int d = 0; d < dir.length; d++) {
            int r = sr + dir[d][0];
            int c = sc + dir[d][1];
            if(r >= 0 && c >= 0 && r < board.length && c < board[0].length &&  board[r][c] == 'O') {
                dfs(board, r, c, dir);

# [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)
Medium


There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
``` 

Constraints:

- 1 <= numCourses <= 2000
- 0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
- prerequisites[i].length == 2
- 0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

# [178 · Graph Valid Tree](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/178/)
Medium

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.


Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5 edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]
Output: true.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5 edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]]
Output: false.
```

## Approach
```
- check if number of edges is equal to n-1 or not
  - if not equal return false;
- do dfs and put it in a set, size of set should be equal to number of nodes
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validTree(int n, int[][] edges) {
     
        if (edges.length != n-1){

# [323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/)
Medium


Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

     0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4 

Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]

     0           4
     |           |
     1 --- 2 --- 3

Output: 1
```
Note: You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

## Approach

# [684. Redundant Connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/)
Medium


In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
 ```

Constraints:

- n == edges.length
- 3 <= n <= 1000
- edges[i].length == 2
- 1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length
- ai != bi
- There are no repeated edges.
- The given graph is connected.

## Approach
```
- Using UnionFind we'll check whether the nodes of the given edge are already connected without using the current edge
- if already connect which means this edge is reduntant
- else union the nodes of the current edge

# [127. Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)
Hard


A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
- Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
- sk == endWord

Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
``` 

Constraints:

- 1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
- endWord.length == beginWord.length
- 1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
- wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
- beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
- beginWord != endWord
- All the words in wordList are unique.

## Approach
```
- Add the begin word to the wordList
- Create a graph such that neighbours of each node is differ by one character
  - eg. fog would be neighbour of cog
- if endWord not present in the graph return 0
- How to find if two words are neighbour?
  - Loop through the two words, whenever it differs increment the count
    - if count == 1 return true else false
- Start bfs search from the beginWord untill we reach the endWord
  - Keep count of distance from beginWord, return distance
