# [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
Easy

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 45

## Approach
```
- Problem effectively becomes fibonacci
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
       int dp[] = new int[n + 1];
       return dp(n, dp);
    }

    public int dp(int n, int[] dp) {
        if(n == 1) return dp[n] = 1;
        if(n == 2) return dp[n] = 2;

        int oneStep = dp(n - 1, dp);
        int twoStep = dp(n - 2, dp);
        
        return dp[n] = oneStep + twoStep;
    }
}
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int one = 1, two = 1;
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            int tmp = one;
            one = one + two;
            two = tmp;
        }
        return one;
    }
}
```



## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

# [746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/)
Easy


You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.
 ```

Constraints:

- 2 <= cost.length <= 1000
- 0 <= cost[i] <= 999


## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        int[] memo = new int[cost.length];
        return Math.min(helper(cost, cost.length - 1, memo), helper(cost, cost.length - 2, memo));
    }
    
      private int helper(int[] cost, int i, int[] memo) {
        if (i < 0) return 0;
        if (i == 0 || i == 1) return cost[i]; // Base cases

        if (memo[i] > 0) return memo[i];

        memo[i] = cost[i] + Math.min(helper(cost, i - 1, memo), helper(cost, i - 2, memo));
        return memo[i];
    }
}

```
