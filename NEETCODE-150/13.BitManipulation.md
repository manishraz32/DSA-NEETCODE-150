# 136. Single Number
Easy


Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
- -3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
      int n = nums.length;
      int num = 0;  
      for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          num = num ^ nums[i];
      }
      return num; 
    }
}
```

# 191. Number of 1 Bits
Easy


Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Note:

Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
 ```

Constraints:

- The input must be a binary string of length 32.
 

### Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for(int i = 31; i>=0; i--) {
            if(((n >> i) & 1) == 1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

# 338. Counting Bits
Easy

Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101
 ```

Constraints:

- 0 <= n <= 105
 

```java
class Solution {
      public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for(int i = 31; i>=0; i--) {
            if(((n >> i) & 1) == 1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public int[] countBits(int n) {
        int[] ans = new int[n + 1];
        for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            int setBit = hammingWeight(i);
            ans[i] = setBit;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

# 268. Missing Number
Easy


Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
 ```

Constraints:

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 104
- 0 <= nums[i] <= n
- All the numbers of nums are unique.
 

### Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

```java
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
        int numsSum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            numsSum = numsSum + nums[i];
        }
        return sum - numsSum;
    }
}
```
