# 704. Binary Search
Easy


Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -104 < nums[i], target < 104
- All the integers in nums are unique.
- nums is sorted in ascending order.

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int l = 0, r = nums.length-1;
        
        while(l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l)/2;
            
            if(nums[mid] == target)
                return mid;
            else if(nums[mid] < target)
                l = mid + 1;
            else
                r = mid - 1;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}

# 74. Search a 2D Matrix
Medium


Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
``` 

Constraints:

- m == matrix.length
- n == matrix[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10<sup>4</sup>

## Approach
```
1st:
- keep two pointer one for row, other for column
- initialize tem to point to the last element of the 1st row
- if the element is equal to target then return true
- else if element is < target then move the row pointer downward
- else shift the column pointer to left

2nd: 
[It would work only when the element at 1st index of next row should be greater then last element of the previous row]
- left pointer at 0, right at n*m-1 (at last element of the matrix)
- do the binarysearch
- target element can be find using 
  - rowIndex = mid / number of elements in each row
  - colIndex = mid % number of elements in each row
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    // worst case go through O(n+m) elements
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        int m = matrix.length, n = matrix[0].length;
        int row = 0, col = n-1;
        while(row >= 0 && row < m && col >= 0 && col < n) {
            int val = matrix[row][col];
            if(val == target)
                return true;
            else if(val < target)
                row++;
            else
                col--;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    // worst case it would go through O(log(n*m)) elements
    public boolean searchMatrix1(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        int m = matrix.length, n = matrix[0].length;
        int left = 0, right = m*n-1;
        while(left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            int val = matrix[mid/n][mid%n];
            if(val == target)
                return true;
            else if(val < target)
                left = mid+1;
            else
                right = mid-1;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity:
  - 1st approach: O(n+m)
  - 2nd approach: O(log(n*m))
- Space Coplexity: O(1) for both approaches

# 875. Koko Eating Bananas
Medium


Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```
Example 2:
```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
```
Example 3:
```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
``` 

Constraints:

- 1 <= piles.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- piles.length <= h <= 10<sup>9</sup>
- 1 <= piles[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>

## Approach
```
- Binary search on range (1, max(pile))
- while the condition satisfies go towards left half
- else go towards right half
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        int left = 1, right = piles[0];
        for(int pile : piles) {
            if(pile < left)
                left = pile;
            if(pile > right)
                right = pile;
        }
        int result = right;
        while(left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(isSatisfy(piles, mid, h)) {
                result = Math.min(result, mid);
                right = mid-1;
            } else {
                left = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    private boolean isSatisfy(int[] piles, int mid, int h) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int pile : piles) {
            count += (pile/mid);
            if(pile%mid != 0)
                count++;
        }
        return count <= h;
    }
}

# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Medium


There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- All values of nums are unique.
- nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= target <= 10<sup>4</sup>

```

## Solution
```java


    public static int search(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int n, int k) {
        int low = 0, high = n - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            // if mid points to the target
            if (arr.get(mid) == k)
                return mid;

            // if left part is sorted
            if (arr.get(low) <= arr.get(mid)) {
                if (arr.get(low) <= k && k <= arr.get(mid)) {
                    // element exists
                    high = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    // element does not exist
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
            } else { // if right part is sorted
                if (arr.get(mid) <= k && k <= arr.get(high)) {
                    // element exists
                    low = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    // element does not exist
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
            }

# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Medium


Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated 4 times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that rotating an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
 ```

Constraints:

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5000
- -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
- All the integers of nums are unique.
- nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

```

## Solution
```java
public static int findMin(int []arr) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            //search space is already sorted
            //then arr[low] will always be
            //the minimum in that search space:
            if (arr[low] <= arr[high]) {
                ans = Math.min(ans, arr[low]);
                break;
            }

            //if left part is sorted:
            if (arr[low] <= arr[mid]) {
                // keep the minimum:
                ans = Math.min(ans, arr[low]);

                // Eliminate left half:
                low = mid + 1;

            } else { //if right part is sorted:

                // keep the minimum:
                ans = Math.min(ans, arr[mid]);

                // Eliminate right half:
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
