# 53. Maximum Subarray
Easy


Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
 

### Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int ansSum = (int)-1e9;
        int currentSum = (int)-1e9;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(currentSum < 0) {
                currentSum = 0;
            }
            currentSum += nums[i];
            ansSum = Math.max(ansSum, currentSum);
        }

        return ansSum;
    }
}
```

# [55. Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)
Medium

You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 105


## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        
        int finall = nums.length - 1;
        
        for(int i=nums.length-2; i>=0; i--){
            if(i+nums[i] >= finall){
                finall=i;
            }
        }
        
        if(finall == 0){
            return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
}

# [45. Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)
Medium


Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000



## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        
        int jump=0, currMax = 0, currEnd = 0;
        
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length-1; i++){
            currMax = Math.max(currMax, i+nums[i]);
            if(i == currEnd){
                jump++;
                currEnd = currMax;
            }
        }
        
        return jump;

# [134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)
Medium


There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

 

Example 1:
```
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
``` 

Constraints:

- n == gas.length == cost.length
- 1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- 0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

## Approach
```
- Trivial:
  - we'll store the difference of gas[i]-cost[i]
  - for all the +ve differences we do the process
```
### TODO:Optimization
## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int totalGas = 0;
        int totalCost = 0;
        int tank = 0;
        int startIndex = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
            totalGas += gas[i];
            totalCost += cost[i];
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i];
            
            // If tank is negative, reset the starting index and tank balance
            if (tank < 0) {
                startIndex = i + 1;
                tank = 0;
            }
        }
        
        // If total gas is less than total cost, return -1
        if (totalGas < totalCost) {
            return -1;
        }

# 1899. Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet

You are given a 2D array of integers triplets, where triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci] represents the ith triplet. You are also given an array of integers target = [x, y, z] which is the triplet we want to obtain.

To obtain target, you may apply the following operation on triplets zero or more times:

Choose two different triplets triplets[i] and triplets[j] and update triplets[j] to become [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)].
* E.g. if triplets[i] = [1, 3, 1] and triplets[j] = [2, 1, 2], triplets[j] will be updated to [max(1, 2), max(3, 1), max(1, 2)] = [2, 3, 2].

Return true if it is possible to obtain target as an element of triplets, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
```
Input: triplets = [[1,2,3],[7,1,1]], target = [7,2,3]
Output: true
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean mergeTriplets(int[][] triplets, int[] target) {
        // Initialize the max values for each element in the triplet
        int[] maxValues = new int[3];

        // Iterate over each triplet
        for (int[] triplet : triplets) {
            // Check if the current triplet can contribute to the target
            if (triplet[0] <= target[0] && triplet[1] <= target[1] && triplet[2] <= target[2]) {
                // Update the max values for each element
                maxValues[0] = Math.max(maxValues[0], triplet[0]);
                maxValues[1] = Math.max(maxValues[1], triplet[1]);
                maxValues[2] = Math.max(maxValues[2], triplet[2]);
            }
        }

        // Check if the max values match the target triplet
        return maxValues[0] == target[0] && maxValues[1] == target[1] && maxValues[2] == target[2];
    }

# 763. Partition Labels

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase english letters.

We want to split the string into as many substrings as possible, while ensuring that each letter appears in at most one substring.

Return a list of integers representing the size of these substrings in the order they appear in the string.

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            lastOccurrence[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i;
        }

        // Step 2: Iterate through the string to determine partitions
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int partitionEnd = 0;
        int partitionStart = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            partitionEnd = Math.max(partitionEnd, lastOccurrence[s.charAt(i) - 'a']);

            // When we reach the end of the current partition
            if (i == partitionEnd) {
                result.add(partitionEnd - partitionStart + 1);
                partitionStart = i + 1; // Move to the next partition
