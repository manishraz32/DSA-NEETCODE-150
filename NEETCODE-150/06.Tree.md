# [226. Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

 ```
Example 1:
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
```
```
Example 2:
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
```
```
Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Approach
```
- Recursion
- store one pointer to right or left subtree
- swap left with right and make call recursively
```

## Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
  public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
       if(root == null) return null;
       TreeNode temp = root.left;
       root.left = root.right;
       root.right = temp;
       invertTree(root.left);
       invertTree(root.right);

       return root;
  }
```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(H), atmost height of tree would be the number of recursive call stack at a given point of time
```

# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

```
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```
```
Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Approach
```
- Recursion
- if node = null return 0
- return 1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight)
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return 0;
        int leftDepth = maxDepth(root.left);
        int rightDepth = maxDepth(root.right);
        return Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(H), height of the tree
```
