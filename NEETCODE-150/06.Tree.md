# [226. Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

 ```
Example 1:
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
```
```
Example 2:
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
```
```
Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Approach
```
- Recursion
- store one pointer to right or left subtree
- swap left with right and make call recursively
```

## Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
  public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
       if(root == null) return null;
       TreeNode temp = root.left;
       root.left = root.right;
       root.right = temp;
       invertTree(root.left);
       invertTree(root.right);

       return root;
  }
```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(H), atmost height of tree would be the number of recursive call stack at a given point of time

# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

```
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```
```
Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Approach
```
- Recursion
- if node = null return 0
- return 1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight)
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return 0;
        int leftDepth = maxDepth(root.left);
        int rightDepth = maxDepth(root.right);
        return Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(H), height of the tree
```

# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree
Easy

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


Example 1:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
 ```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

```java
class Solution {
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        int[] max = new int[1];
        diameter(root, max);
        return max[0];
    }
    public int diameter(TreeNode root, int[] max) {
        if(root == null) return 0;
        
        int leftHeight = diameter(root.left, max);
        int rightHeight = diameter(root.right, max);
        max[0] = Math.max(max[0], leftHeight + rightHeight);

        return 1 + Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    }
}
```

# 110. Balanced Binary Tree
Easy

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
```

Example 3:
```
Input: root = []
Output: true
```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
- -104 <= Node.val <= 104

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return true;
        int height = height(root);
        return height == -1 ? false : true;
    }

    public int height(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return 0;
        int lh = height(root.left);
        int rh = height(root.right);
        if(lh == -1 || rh == -1) return -1;
        if(Math.abs(lh - rh) > 1) return -1;
        return Math.max(lh, rh) + 1;
    }

}
```

# 100. Same Tree
Easy

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

Example 3:
```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
 ```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
- -104 <= Node.val <= 104

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(p == null && q == null) return true;
        if(p == null && q != null) return false;
        if(p != null && q == null) return false;
        if(p.val != q.val) return false;
        boolean left = isSameTree(p.left, q.left);
        boolean right = isSameTree(p.right, q.right);

        return left && right;
    }
}
```
