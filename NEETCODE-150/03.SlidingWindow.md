# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Easy


You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= prices.length <= 105
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 104

```java
 public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
    int buy = 0;
    int sell = 0;
    int profit = 0;
    int n = prices.length;
    while(sell++ < n - 1) {
         profit = Math.max(profit, prices[sell]-prices[buy]);
         if (prices[sell] < prices[buy]){
            buy = sell;
         }   
     }
     return profit;
    }
```

# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Medium


Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 ```

Constraints:

- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {

        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (s.length() == 1) {
            return 1;
        }

        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        int ans = 0;

        HashSet < Character > set = new HashSet < > ();

        while (right < s.length()) {
            char c = s.charAt(right);
            while (set.contains(c)) {
                set.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }
            set.add(c);
            ans = Math.max(ans, right - left + 1);
            right++;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
Medium


You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
``` 

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- s consists of only uppercase English letters.
- 0 <= k <= s.length

## Notes
```
- use a map to store the frequency
- maxRepeatingCharCount = max(maxRepeatingCharCount, mp.get(char))
- slide the left pointer until the equation satifies: windowEnd - windowStart + 1 - maxRepeatingCharCount > k
- maxLen = max(maxLen, windowEnd - windowStart + 1)
```

## Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        
        int[] occurance = new int[26];
        int left = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        int maxOccurance = 0;
        
        for(int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++){
            maxOccurance = Math.max(maxOccurance, ++occurance[s.charAt(right) - 'A']);
            if(right - left + 1 - maxOccurance > k){
                occurance[s.charAt(left) - 'A']--;
                left++;
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, right-left + 1);
        }
        return ans;  
    }
}
```
