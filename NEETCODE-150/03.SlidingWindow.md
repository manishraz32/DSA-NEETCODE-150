# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Easy


You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= prices.length <= 105
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 104

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        if(n == 1) return 0;
        int maxP = 0;
        int l = 0, r = 1;
        
        while(r < n) {
            if(prices[l] < prices[r]) {
                int profit = prices[r] - prices[l];
                maxP = Math.max(maxP, profit);
            } else
                l = r;
            r++;
        }
        return maxP;
    }
}
```

# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Medium


Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 ```

Constraints:

- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> mp = new HashMap<>();
        int maxLen = 0, winStart = 0;
        
        for(int winEnd = 0; winEnd < s.length(); winEnd++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(winEnd);
            if(mp.containsKey(ch)) {
                winStart = Math.max(winStart, mp.get(ch)+1);
            }
            mp.put(ch, winEnd);
            maxLen = Math.max(winEnd - winStart + 1, maxLen);
        }
        return maxLen;        
    }
}
```
