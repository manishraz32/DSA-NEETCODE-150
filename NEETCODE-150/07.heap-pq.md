# 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream
Easy

Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Implement KthLargest class:

- KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.
- int add(int val) Appends the integer val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.
 

Example 1:
```
Input
["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
[[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]
Output
[null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]
```

Explanation
```
KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2]);
kthLargest.add(3);   // return 4
kthLargest.add(5);   // return 5
kthLargest.add(10);  // return 5
kthLargest.add(9);   // return 8
kthLargest.add(4);   // return 8
 ```

Constraints:
- 1 <= k <= 104
- 0 <= nums.length <= 104
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- -104 <= val <= 104
- At most 104 calls will be made to add.
- It is guaranteed that there will be at least k elements in the array when you search for the kth element.

```java
class KthLargest {

    private PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap;
    private int k;

    public KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) {
        this.k = k;
        this.minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(k); // Min-heap with a capacity of k

        // Add initial elements to the heap
        for (int num : nums) {
            add(num);
        }
    }

    public int add(int val) {
        if (minHeap.size() < k) {
            minHeap.offer(val);
        } else if (val > minHeap.peek()) {
            minHeap.poll(); // Remove the smallest element
            minHeap.offer(val); // Add the new value
        }

        return minHeap.peek(); // Return the kth largest element
    }
}
```

# 1046. Last Stone Weight
Easy

You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: stones = [1]
Output: 1
 ```

Constraints:
- 1 <= stones.length <= 30
- 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000

```java
class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b-a); // max heap, Collections.reverseOrder()
        
        for(int stone : stones)
            pq.offer(stone);
        
        while(pq.size() > 1) {
            int x = pq.poll();
            int y = pq.poll();
            if(x != y) {
                pq.offer(x-y); // abs not rqd as x would always be greater than equal to y
            }
        }
        
        return pq.isEmpty()?0:pq.peek();
    }
}

# 973. K Closest Points to Origin
Medium


Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., √(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

 

Example 1:
```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= k <= points.length <= <sup>4</sup>
- -10<sup>4</sup> < xi, yi < <sup>4</sup>

## Approach
```
- Have a Max PriorityQueue based on euclidean distance
- add each point to PQ, if size > k then poll
- remaining points inside the PQ is the answer
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int k) {
        int[][] res = new int[k][2];
        PriorityQueue<Point> pq = new PriorityQueue<Point>((a, b) -> new Double(b.dist).compareTo(new Double(a.dist)));
        
        for(int[] point: points) {
            pq.offer(new Point(point[0], point[1]));

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(nlogk) -> Adding to/removing from the heap (or priority queue) 
                            only takes O(\log k) time when the size of the heap is capped at k elements.
- Space Complexity: O(k) -> The heap (or priority queue) will contain at most kk elements.
```
